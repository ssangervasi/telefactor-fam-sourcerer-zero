# Boilerplate Specs

These tests are quite slow 🐌

These tests are for the CLI and File I/O part of the code which will not go away
between turns. This is to make sure the app still runs to some extent, but it
doesn't check any very interesting behavior.

Note that they won't go away, but if you modify them they'll be reset.
No sneaking behavior tests in here.
